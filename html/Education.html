                <p>To apply my behavioral skills in the industry, I have taken the initiative to become a dog trainer. Dog training is a perfect way to practice animal behavior assessment, enrichment, and education. </p>

            <h1>Michigan State<br/>University</h1>
            <p>Even at a young age, I knew I wanted to go to Michigan State University. Initially, I entered the school intending to finish my bachelor's of science in zoology with a concentration in zoo and aquarium sciences to then carry on to veterinarian school to become a zoo veterinarian. </p>

            <p>At MSU, I joined a co-ed professional zoology fraternity known as Zeta Theta Omega. In this fraternity, I participated in philanthropy events that supported various animal organizations such as Reef Check, Mid-Michigan Cat Rescue, and Turning Pointe Donkey Rescue. When the election season arrived, I jumped at the opportunity to run for president of the fraternity and won. During my time as president, I led a chapter of over fifty intelligent animal-loving students and assisted them in their professional development and animal skills. As president, I held weekly meetings and hosted events to help support our philanthropy efforts.</br></br>I fell in love with animal behavior during my first behavior course and decided to pursue the animal behavior and neurobiology concentration. Taking on a large credit load with primarily STEM courses was no easy task, but one I approached head-on. With determination and persistence, I graduated in only three years.</p>

                <h1>Here are some interesting Courses I've taken:</h1>
                <h2>Biology of Mammals</h2>
                    <p>Biology of Mammals introduced me to the skill of identifying animals based on their skull. We memorized the Latin Order and Family names for several mammals and were able to identify specimens in this way. I also learned the diet, habitat, and lifestyle of each mammalian family.</p>
                <h2>Animal Welfare Assessment</h2>
                    <p>The animal welfare assessment course offered by Michigan State University is a fully online graduate course where we learn how to assess an animal's behavior and environment. Based on the assessment, I then offered plausible solutions to provide better welfare to the animal. This skill is useful for farms that may not possess the funding to give each animal individual treatment but still wish to provide their livestock with humane care.</p>
                <h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
                    <p>I learned how animals communicate with each other and understand the reasoning behind certain behaviors. For example, why it is genetically more beneficial to take care of your relative's offspring to pass along more of your family genes.</p>
                <h2>Comparative Anatomy and Biology of Vertebrates</h2>
                    <p>Comparative anatomy had us working hands-on, dissecting a cat, dogfish shark, mudpuppy, and lamprey. I learned the major muscles, organs, veins, arteries, and more on each specimen.</p>
                <h2>Neural Basis of Animal Behavior</h2>
                    <p>In the neural basis of animal behavior, we got to learn the neurological reasoning behind animal behavior and how different events can affect the neural pathways, which in turn affect the animal's behavior. We also learned how toxins affect the brain on a molecular level.</p>
                <h2>Conservation Ethics</h2>
                    <p>In conservation ethics, we discussed controversial ethics topics among the environment and politics. Different theories and viewpoints expressed during the course allowed me to observe issues from several perspectives. Gaining the skill to debate respectfully with colleagues is one that I can use in any industry I enter.</p>
